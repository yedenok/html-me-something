    <h3>&star;Backstory&star;</h3>
        <p>This is the world of Lakore. Lakore has modern level sensibilities, and modern level
    technology... in the north. In the south part of the world grows an entity known as
    The Chaos. It's a massive, intangible force of entropy. The closer one gets to the
    Chaos, the less technology works. It can manipulate probability to make things fail
    in ways they otherwise wouldn't, like exploding. No one knows if the Chaos is sentient
    or simply a force of nature (truthfully, few even know about it in the first place),
    but it's clear that if it keeps growing, the whole world will eventually be sent back 
    to medieval times.
        </p>
        <p>The world of Lakore also has a single goddess. Known only as the Glinting Lady, she
    has a small following in the forest of [Name]. Over a decade ago, the Glinting Lady
    took part of her own magic, and sent it out into the world to cause the birth of six
    Heroes who would one day fight the Chaos. That day is today...

        <h3>&star;Our Heroes&star;</h3>

        <img src = "C:\Users\shado\lc101\html-me-something\Pictures\heather.png" 
        alt = "Heather Goodwin">
        <p>Heather is a 17 year old girl living in the [Name] Forest commune. Both of her parents
    were followers of the Glinting Lady, and Heather was raised primarily by the goddess
    herself. She is the only character available at the start of the game, being sent out 
    to find the other heroes. Heather is a Support class, and specializes in magic that
    heals and fortifies her teammates.
</p>
<h4>&star;Dedrick Maynard&star;</h4>
<img src = "C:\Users\shado\lc101\html-me-something\Pictures\dedrick.png" 
alt = "Dedrick Maynard">
<p>Dedrick is a 16 year old boy living in the town of [Name]. He's a kind individual who
    spends his time watching the town's children. He joins the party when Heather tells
    him that the Chaos poses a threat to his neighbors. Dedrick is a Defense class, with 
    lots of health and toughness, and fights with a sword. </p>
<h4>&star;Li Yanmei&star;</h4>
<img src = "C:\Users\shado\lc101\html-me-something\Pictures\yanmei.png" 
alt = "Li Yanmei">
<p>Yanmei is a 16 year old girl living in the city of [Name]. She's gorgeous and charismatic
    from a wealthy family, and people she meets can't help but to do what she wants. She joins
    the party to get away from her parents. Yanmei is an Offense class, and specializes in 
    damaging magic like fireballs.
</p>
<h4>&star;Basir Hakim&star;</h4>
<img src = "C:\Users\shado\lc101\html-me-something\Pictures\basir.png" 
alt = "Basir Hakim">
<p>Basir is a 10 year old boy living in the city of [Name]. He attends [Name] Academy,
    a prestigious institute for geniuses. He's fairly shy and humble despite his massive
    intellect, and often hides behind his adoptive older sister, Zakiya. He joins the party 
    after Zakiya promises to stay with him. Basir is a Support class, and specializes in 
    magic that weakens and immobilizes his foes.
</p>
<h4>&star;Carlyn O'Kelley&star;</h4>
<img src = "C:\Users\shado\lc101\html-me-something\Pictures\carlyn.png" 
alt = "Carlyn O'Kelley"> 
<p>Carlyn is a 10 year old girl living in a forest with her brother Sean and their friend
    Niyol. Her brother Sean took her and ran away into the forest 5 years ago, where they
    have been hunting and gathering ever since. She joins the party after they agree to 
    allow Sean to join as well. Carlyn is an Offense class with super strength, and she fights
    with a giant hammer.
</p>
<h4>&star;Niyol Fletcher&star;</h4>
<img src = "C:\Users\shado\lc101\html-me-something\Pictures\niyol.png" 
alt = "Niyol Fletcher"> 
<p>Niyol is 15 years old and genderfluid. They are fast and dexterous. Their superhuman
    abilities led to them being kept in a lab for much of their young life, but they 
    eventually escaped and fled to the forest where Carlyn and Sean were living. Niyol 
    is a Defense class, specializing in dodging attacks, and dual wields knives.
</p>
<h4>&star;Zakiya Travere&star;</h4>
<img src = "C:\Users\shado\lc101\html-me-something\Pictures\zakiya.png" 
alt = "Zakiya Travere"> 
<p>Zakiya is a 16 year old girl living in the city of [Name]. She attends [Name] Academy
    with Basir, and acts as his older sister. She is not one of the goddess's heroes, but
    joins the party anyway because Basir is too scared to go alone. Even though she doesn't 
    have magic, she's still formidable. Zakiya is a Special class, with offensive and 
    supportive abilites using technology that she can make work even inside the Chaos.
</p>
<h4>&star;Sean O'Kelley&star;</h4>
<img src = "C:\Users\shado\lc101\html-me-something\Pictures\sean.png" 
alt = "Sean O'Kelley"> 
<p>Sean is a 17 year old boy, and Carlyn's brother. He is not one of the heroes, 
    but joins the party because Carlyn refuses to go without him. 5 years ago, he heard a 
    story about a little kid being taken away to a lab to study their superhuman abilities,
    and, fearing the same would happen to his super strong sister, ran away with her. He is 
    a Special class, fighting with a bow, as well as being able to disarm traps and pick locks.
